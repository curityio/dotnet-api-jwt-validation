This repository contains example code on how to use JWTs for authorization in .NET APIs. This will be managed using the `.NET Core Security Framework <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/?view=aspnetcore-8.0/>`_. This allows for easy annotation of an endpoint to specify authorization policies.

::

    [HttpGet("developer")]
    [Authorize(Policy = "developer")]
    public IActionResult Developer()
    {
        ...
    }


This repository contains the result of the `Securing .NET Core API with JWT <https://curity.io/resources/learn/dotnet-api/>`_ article. That article contains more in-depth information about the source code.

Run the example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update the ``appsettings.json`` according to the article.

Then run

:: 

    dotnet restore
    dotnet run
